 Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

##  Description
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of cars using machine learning techniques. The prediction is based on various car-related features such as car age, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and ownership details. The project demonstrates a real-world regression problem solved using Python.

##  Dataset
- File Name: car data.csv  
- Features Used:
- Year (converted to Car Age)
 - Present Price
 - Kilometers Driven
 - Fuel Type
 - Transmission
 - Owner
- Target Variable: Selling Price

---

 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  


## ⚙ How It Works
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Clean the data and handle categorical variables  
3. Perform feature engineering (convert Year to Car Age)  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Train a regression model  
6. Evaluate model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² score

##  Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Regressor  
- Chosen for better performance on non-linear and real-world data  

---

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score  

---

##  Goal
To understand and implement a real-world **machine learning regression problem** and gain practical experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Outcome
The trained model successfully predicts car prices with good accuracy and provides insights into the most important features affecting car prices.
